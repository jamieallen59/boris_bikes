Boris bikes
===========

![](images/boris.jpg)

The Boris bikes program is where we started learning about OOP by building a Boris Bike rental system using Bike, DockingStation, Van, Garage and Person classes.

Hopefully the code will be well structured and easy to understand.

Here i've completed it in the Chicago style of testing, with no doubles.

### To run the tests
```shell
git clone git@github.com:jamieallen59/boris_bikes.git
cd boris-bikes
rspec
```
