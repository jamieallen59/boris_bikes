Boris bikes
===========

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamieallen59/boris_bikes/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/jamieallen59/boris_bikes)

We built the Boris Bikes program to learn more about Object Oriented Programming. We constructed the rental system using Bike, DockingStation, Van, Garage and Person classes.

Hopefully the code will be well structured and easy to understand.

The program is tested in the Chicago style, with no doubles.

### To run the tests
```shell
git clone git@github.com:jamieallen59/boris_bikes.git
cd boris-bikes
rspec
```
